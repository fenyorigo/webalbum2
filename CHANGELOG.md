## 1.5.6 - 2026-03-05

## 1.5.5 - 2026-02-23
- Fixed image rotate persistence path end-to-end: added rotate route wiring in backend router and ensured requests hit authenticated rotate controller.
- Hardened media rotation result consistency by normalizing image EXIF orientation after rotate and clearing video rotate metadata.

- Increased Required tools modal width for better readability.
- Added safer runtime env handling for tool checks (`HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `TMPDIR`) to avoid dconf cache permission warnings under Apache context.

## 1.5.3 - 2026-02-22
- Added Admin audit log CSV export (`Export logs (CSV)`) with current filter support.

- Search merge now prefers MariaDB asset rows over SQLite `other` rows for asset-managed extensions (`pdf`, `txt`, `doc`, `docx`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `ppt`, `pptx`, `mp3`, `m4a`, `flac`) to avoid duplicate/confusing results in `Type = Any`.

- Added rotate controls (clockwise/counterclockwise) in image and video viewer modals.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-02-16

- Fixed ambiguous duplicate results when filtering by `ext` (e.g. `pdf`) by treating extension-filtered searches as assets-only.
- Added Required tools checks/display for `imagemagick`, `pecl`, and PHP `imagick` extension.
- Added worker deployment templates under `backend/deploy/systemd` and documented Fedora timer/service setup.
- Updated assets worker batch mode so `--max-jobs=N` exits cleanly when the queue is empty.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-02-16

- Completed assets handling (video, documents) with Admin Assets workflow.
- Added documents/audio asset indexing, async derivative jobs, and worker processing.

- Added queue split by job type (`doc_thumb` vs `doc_pdf_preview`) in admin status views.
- Added support for `ppt` and `pptx` document conversion/preview/thumbnail flow.
- Merged doc/audio folders into the sidebar folder tree for browsing/search.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-02-15
